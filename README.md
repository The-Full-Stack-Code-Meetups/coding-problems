<h2>Problem 1</h2>
Difficulty: Easy
This problem was asked by Twitter.

You run an e-commerce website and want to record the last N order ids in a log. Implement a data structure to accomplish this, with the following API:

record(order_id): adds the order_id to the log
get_last(i): gets the ith last element from the log. i is guaranteed to be smaller than or equal to N. You should be as efficient with time and space as possible.
You should be as efficient with time and space as possible.

<h2>Problem 3</h2>

This problem was asked by Square.
Given a string and a set of characters, return the shortest substring containing all the characters in the set.

For example, given the string "figehaeci" and the set of characters {a, e, i}, you should return "aeci".

If there is no substring containing all the characters in the set, return null.

<h2>Problem 4</h2>
Given a string and a pattern, find the starting indices of all occurrences of the pattern in the string. For example, given the string abracadabra and the pattern abr, you should return [0, 7].

<h2>Problem 5</h2>
This problem was asked by Facebook.
Given an array of numbers representing the stock prices of a company in chronological order, write a function that calculates the maximum profit you could have made from buying and selling that stock once. You must buy before you can sell it.

For example, given [9, 11, 8, 5, 7, 10], you should return 5, since you could buy the stock at 5 dollars and sell it at 10 dollars.
