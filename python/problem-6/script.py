#This problem was asked by Facebook.
#Write a function that rotates a list by k elements. 
#For example, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] rotated by two becomes [3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2]. 
#Try solving this without creating a copy of the list. 
#How many swap or move operations do you need?

def rotate(nums, k):
    r = -(k % len(nums))
    if len(nums[:r]): nums[:r], nums[r:] = nums[r:], nums[:r]
    else: nums[r:], nums[:r] = nums[:r], nums[r:]
    print(nums)
